# case-bi-working-student-visualization

The case revolves around a hypothetical online store â€“ Superstore. They're selling merchandise in different product categories to customers within the United States. Imagine yourself as a BI specialist in a company and one manager send you a the following request:

*"Hi! I need to better understand customer performance. Ideally, we should create segments base on customer performance and compare them. On top of that, I am concerned about the increasing number of returns, do you have any insights regarding that? Let me know when we can talk"*

Additional to this request above, the BI team from FELD M will replace the manager role and offer you a 30-min requirements collection session (it will be arranged through your People & Teams team contact person) in which you get to ask us questions to have better clarity of what's needed in the dashboard.

Once requirements collected,  please execute the following: 

**Tasks** 

1.  Connect to the Superstore data in Tableau Desktop
2.  Depending on the requirements collected from the call with the stakeholder/s, build a dashboard/s that reflects the user needs, keeping these initial and collected requirements in mind
3.  Archive your work and send it to the person who provided you the case via email. NOTE: save the workbook in a Tableau Packaged Workbook format.

**What we'll be evaluating your submissions on**  

1.  Deriving the needed requirements to build the dashboard and your communication skills with the stakeholder/s.
2.  Your dashboard follows best data visualisation practices, e.g., appropriate chart types, suitable dashboard structure, clear explanation for first time users.
3.  Your work considers the business / data at hand and the likely requirements of the stakeholder.
